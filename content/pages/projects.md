Simulation Exercise
-------------------

Teams of three students will manage a virtual factory in a Web-based simulation exercise for about one week. The goal of this assignment is to let them adapt and apply concepts from the class in a managerial situation; it will also give them a chance to formalize their own decision models and test their relevance and effectiveness. After the simulation is over, each team will turn in a written report of at most four pages containing:

1.  Description of the strategy that was followed, with a detailed explanation of its underlying rationale (description of all quantitative models or reasoning used to come up with this strategy);
2.  Assessment of its performance;
3.  A posteriori suggestions for improving your performance in this simulation;
4.  Description of the most important lessons you learned or insights you gained.

This team exercise is worth 30% of a student's grade: 20% for the report, and 10% for the simulation performance. Experience demonstrates that _advance planning_ and _sound use of quantitative models_ provide key competitive advantages in this game.

Littlefield Technology Simulation Exercise: Assignment Description

### Questions

Answers to these questions should be included in the group's simulation write-up:

1.  Describe the strategy that you followed and provide a detailed explanation of its underlying rationale (in particular, description of all quantitative models used to come up with this strategy).
2.  Assess your team's performance throughout the simulation.
3.  A posteriori, what could you have done differently to improve your performance in this simulation?
4.  (Provide supporting quantitative models and explain your reasoning/rational as appropriate).
5.  Describe any lessons you learned or insights you gained in this exercise.

### Schedule

A timeline of the exercise is provided in the table below. The actual simulation is conducted over the course of one week.
